        <h2>Hello! Welcome to the Ridgewater College Cost Calculator!</h2>
        <p>This calculator will help you estimate how much your college expenses <u>may</u> cost. It takes costs such as tuition, room and boarding, books and supplies, personal expenses, and transportation expenses into account to estimate your total cost. </p>
        <p>This calculator also has the option to include financial aid and scholarships to reduce your final amount.</p>
        <p><b>How to Use:</b></p>
        <p>Fill in information as prompted by the questions in each section. If you donâ€™t know how to answer a question, you can skip over it entirely or choose <i>"I'm not sure"</i> (if available). After finishing all 6 sections, you will get a final estimated total as well as a breakdown of each section and an overall cost pie chart, revealing the percentages that make up your total.</p>
        <p><strong>* Note: This calculator gives an estimated cost total - it will not be an exact amount</strong></p>
